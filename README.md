![](./.preview/dfc-01.png)

A flashcards app for developers!

Features a 155 cards deck with content from the awesome [Javascript Questions by Lydia Hallie.](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions)

PS

I'm still figuring out the UI, animations, and a bunch of other things, so the project is very much a WIP at the moment.
