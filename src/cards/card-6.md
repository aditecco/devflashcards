```javascript
class Chameleon {
  static colorChange(newColor) {
    this.newColor = newColor;
    return this.newColor;
  }

  constructor({ newColor = 'green' } = {}) {
    this.newColor = newColor;
  }
}

const freddie = new Chameleon({ newColor: 'purple' });
console.log(freddie.colorChange('orange'));
```

- A: `orange`
- B: `purple`
- C: `green`
- D: `TypeError`




SPLIT_MARKER

The `colorChange` function is static. Static methods are designed to live only on the constructor in which they are created, and cannot be passed down to any children. Since `freddie` is a child, the function is not passed down, and not available on the `freddie` instance: a `TypeError` is thrown.
