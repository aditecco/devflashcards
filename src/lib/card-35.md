```javascript

console.log(numbers);
```

- A: `[1, 2, 3, 7 x null, 11]`

SPLIT_MARKER

When you set a value to an element in an array that exceeds the length of the array, JavaScript creates something called "empty slots". These actually have the value of `undefined`, but you will see something like:

`[1, 2, 3, 7 x empty, 11]`

depending on where you run it (it's different for every browser, node, etc.)
