```javascript
// ðŸŽ‰âœ¨ This is my 100th question! âœ¨ðŸŽ‰

const output = `${[] && 'Im'}possible!
You should${'' && `n't`} see a therapist after so much JavaScript lol`;
```

- A: `possible! You should see a therapist after so much JavaScript lol`
- B: `Impossible! You should see a therapist after so much JavaScript lol`
- C: `possible! You shouldn't see a therapist after so much JavaScript lol`
- D: `Impossible! You shouldn't see a therapist after so much JavaScript lol`




SPLIT_MARKER

`[]` is a truthy value. With the `&&` operator, the right-hand value will be returned if the left-hand value is a truthy value. In this case, the left-hand value `[]` is a truthy value, so `"Im'` gets returned.

`""` is a falsy value. If the left-hand value is falsy, nothing gets returned. `n't` doesn't get returned.
