answer: Answer: C

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Lydia Hallie",
  age: 21
}

[...person] // ["Lydia Hallie", 21]
```

- A: Nothing, object are iterable by default
- B: `*[Symbol.iterator]() { for (let x in this) yield* this[x] }`
- C: `*[Symbol.iterator]() { yield* Object.values(this) }`
- D: `*[Symbol.iterator]() { for (let x in this) yield this }`






Objects aren't iterable by default. An iterable is an iterable if the iterator protocol is present. We can add this manually by adding the iterator symbol `[Symbol.iterator]`, which has to return a generator object, for example by making it a generator function `*[Symbol.iterator]() {}`. This generator function has to yield the `Object.values` of the `person` object if we want it to return the array `["Lydia Hallie", 21]`: `yield* Object.values(this)`.
