```javascript
let newList = [1, 2, 3].push(4);

console.log(newList.push(5));
```

- A: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- B: `[1, 2, 3, 5]`
- C: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- D: `Error`




SPLIT_MARKER

The `.push` method returns the _new length_ of the array, not the array itself! By setting `newList` equal to `[1, 2, 3].push(4)`, we set `newList` equal to the new length of the array: `4`.

Then, we try to use the `.push` method on `newList`. Since `newList` is the numerical value `4`, we cannot use the `.push` method: a TypeError is thrown.
