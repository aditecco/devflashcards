SPLIT_MARKER

Each function has its own _execution context_ (or _scope_). The `getName` function first looks within its own context (scope) to see if it contains the variable `name` we're trying to access. In this case, the `getName` function contains its own `name` variable: we declare the variable `name` with the `let` keyword, and with the value of `'Sarah'`.

Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the "temporal dead zone". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.

If we wouldn't have declared the `name` variable within the `getName` function, the javascript engine would've looked down the _scope chain_. The outer scope has a variable called `name` with the value of `Lydia`. In that case, it would've logged `Lydia`.

```javascript
let name = 'Lydia';

function getName() {
  console.log(name);
}

getName(); // Lydia
```
