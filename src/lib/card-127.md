answer: Answer: D

```javascript
const randomValue = 21;

function getInfo() {
  console.log(typeof randomValue);
  const randomValue = 'Lydia Hallie';
}

getInfo();
```

- A: `"number"`
- B: `"string"`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`






Variables declared with the `const` keyword are not referencable before their initialization: this is called the _temporal dead zone_. In the `getInfo` function, the variable `randomValue` is scoped in the functional scope of `getInfo`. On the line where we want to log the value of `typeof randomValue`, the variable `randomValue` isn't initialized yet: a `ReferenceError` gets thrown! The engine didn't go down the scope chain since we declared the variable `randomValue` in the `getInfo` function.
