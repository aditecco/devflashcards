```javascript
const groceries = ['banana', 'apple', 'peanuts'];

if (groceries.indexOf('banana')) {
  console.log('We have to buy bananas!');
} else {
  console.log(`We don't have to buy bananas!`);
}
```

- A: We have to buy bananas!
- B: We don't have to buy bananas
- C: `undefined`
- D: `1`




SPLIT_MARKER

We passed the condition `groceries.indexOf("banana")` to the if-statement. `groceries.indexOf("banana")` returns `0`, which is a falsy value. Since the condition in the if-statement is falsy, the code in the `else` block runs, and `We don't have to buy bananas!` gets logged.
