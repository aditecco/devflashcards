title: What's the value of `sum`?
answer: Answer: A
---

  

```javascript
const sum = eval('10*10+5');
```

- A: `105`
- B: `"105"`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `"10*10+5"`






`eval` evaluates codes that's passed as a string. If it's an expression, like in this case, it evaluates the expression. The expression is `10 * 10 + 5`. This returns the number `105`.
