SPLIT_MARKER

In order to get an character on a specific index in a string, you can use bracket notation. The first character in the string has index 0, and so on. In this case we want to get the element which index is 0, the character `"I'`, which gets logged.

Note that this method is not supported in IE7 and below. In that case, use `.charAt()`
