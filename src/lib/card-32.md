answer: Answer: B

```javascript
function sayHi() {
  return (() => 0)();
}

console.log(typeof sayHi());
```

- A: `"object"`
- B: `"number"`
- C: `"function"`
- D: `"undefined"`




SPLIT_MARKER

The `sayHi` function returns the returned value of the immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). This function returned `0`, which is type `"number"`.

FYI: there are only 7 built-in types: `null`, `undefined`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `object`, and `symbol`. `"function"` is not a type, since functions are objects, it's of type `"object"`.
