```javascript
const spookyItems = ['👻', '🎃', '🕸'];
({ item: spookyItems[3] } = { item: '💀' });

console.log(spookyItems);
```

- A: `["👻", "🎃", "🕸"]`
- B: `["👻", "🎃", "🕸", "💀"]`
- C: `["👻", "🎃", "🕸", { item: "💀" }]`
- D: `["👻", "🎃", "🕸", "[object Object]"]`






By destructuring objects, we can unpack values from the right-hand object, and assign the unpacked value to the value of the same property name on the left-hand object. In this case, we're assigning the value "💀" to `spookyItems[3]`. This means that we're modifying the `spookyItems` array, we're adding the "💀" to it. When logging `spookyItems`, `["👻", "🎃", "🕸", "💀"]` gets logged.
