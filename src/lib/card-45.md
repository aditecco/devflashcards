```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Lydia',
  age: 21,
};

for (const item in person) {
  console.log(item);
}
```

- A: `{ name: "Lydia" }, { age: 21 }`
- B: `"name", "age"`
- C: `"Lydia", 21`
- D: `["name", "Lydia"], ["age", 21]`






With a `for-in` loop, we can iterate through object keys, in this case `name` and `age`. Under the hood, object keys are strings (if they're not a Symbol). On every loop, we set the value of `item` equal to the current key it’s iterating over. First, `item` is equal to `name`, and gets logged. Then, `item` is equal to `age`, which gets logged.
