```javascript
function getAge() {
  'use strict';
  age = 21;
  console.log(age);
}

getAge();
```

- A: `21`
- B: `undefined`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `TypeError`






With `"use strict"`, you can make sure that you don't accidentally declare global variables. We never declared the variable `age`, and since we use `"use strict"`, it will throw a reference error. If we didn't use `"use strict"`, it would have worked, since the property `age` would have gotten added to the global object.
