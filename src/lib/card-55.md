```javascript
// counter.js
let counter = 10;
export default counter;
```

```javascript
// index.js
import myCounter from './counter';

myCounter += 1;

console.log(myCounter);
```

- A: `10`
- B: `11`
- C: `Error`
- D: `NaN`






An imported module is _read-only_: you cannot modify the imported module. Only the module that exports them can change its value.

When we try to increment the value of `myCounter`, it throws an error: `myCounter` is read-only and cannot be modified.
