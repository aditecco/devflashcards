```javascript
const animals = {};
let dog = { emoji: '🐶' }
let cat = { emoji: '🐈' }

animals[dog] = { ...dog, name: "Mara" }
animals[cat] = { ...cat, name: "Sara" }

console.log(animals[dog])
```

- A: `{ emoji: "🐶", name: "Mara" }`
- B: `{ emoji: "🐈", name: "Sara" }`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`




SPLIT_MARKER

Object keys are converted to strings. 

Since the value of  `dog` is an object,  `animals[dog]` actually means that we’re creating a new property called `"object Object"` equal to the new object. `animals["object Object"]` is now equal to `{ emoji: "🐶", name: "Mara"}`.

`cat` is also an object, which means that `animals[cat]` actually means that we’re overwriting the value of  `animals[``"``object Object``"``]` with the new cat properties. 

Logging `animals[dog]`, or actually `animals["object Object"]` since converting the `dog` object to a string results `"object Object"`, returns the `{ emoji: "🐈", name: "Sara" }`.
