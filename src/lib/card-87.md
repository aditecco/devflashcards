```javascript
// module.js
export default () => 'Hello world';
export const name = 'Lydia';

// index.js
import * as data from './module';

console.log(data);
```

- A: `{ default: function default(), name: "Lydia" }`
- B: `{ default: function default() }`
- C: `{ default: "Hello world", name: "Lydia" }`
- D: Global object of `module.js`




SPLIT_MARKER

With the `import * as name` syntax, we import _all exports_ from the `module.js` file into the `index.js` file as a new object called `data` is created. In the `module.js` file, there are two exports: the default export, and a named export. The default export is a function which returns the string `"Hello World"`, and the named export is a variable called `name` which has the value of the string `"Lydia"`.

The `data` object has a `default` property for the default export, other properties have the names of the named exports and their corresponding values.
